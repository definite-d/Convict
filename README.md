# Convict Image Converter

A quick GUI enabled Python image converter.
Depends majorly on PIL and PySimpleGUI

Handy for those times when you need to convert a PNG to an icon (.ico or .icns, doesn't matter) with no stress, all offline. Or when you get your hands on a .webp and you don't know what to do with it. Or your paranoid Adobe loving coworker needs an image as a PDF for no good reason.
Or maybe you just need a simple image conversion to satisfy some SaaS's picky requirements.

It gets even better if you need a dark mode with that. And source code access.

Hm. Guess that's all about it.

Why is it called Convict?
Honestly, I don't know either.
Maybe you could think of it as a way to imprison that pesky restriction on your images' file formats.
