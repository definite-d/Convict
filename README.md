### Meet *Convict*: Your No-Nonsense Python Image Converter (COMING SOON)

Got a PNG you need as an `.ico` in seconds? Wrestling with a `.webp` because your favorite app won’t touch it yet—or maybe *you actually need a `.webp`* for once? Or perhaps you’re stuck converting an image to PDF because *someone* just won’t accept anything else. That’s where *Convict* comes in.  

#### What Makes *Convict* Awesome:  
- **Effortless Conversion**:  
  - PNG to `.ico` or `.icns`? Done.  
  - `.webp` to something usable? Absolutely.  
  - Back to `.webp` because it’s the format you need? You bet.  
  - Image to PDF? Yep, even that’s covered.  

- **Offline and Private**: All the magic happens on your machine—no cloud, no data leaks.  

- **Thoughtful Design**:  
  - Slick dark mode for when you’re burning the midnight oil.  
  - Open-source for those who like to tweak.  

#### Why the Name?  
Because *Convict* locks down your image problems and sets you free.  

We love `.webp`—but not every app does. Whether you’re converting to it or from it, *Convict* has your back. No fluff, no fuss—just what you need to get the job done.
